	Real Analysis I
	<br>
	(archived course page from Fall 2016)
    </h3></center>
	<br>
	This class covers the basics of Lebesgue integration in n-dimensional Euclidean space (construction of the Lebesgue integral, covering lemmas, the Lebesgue differentiation theorem), measure spaces in general, basics of functional analysis (Hilbert and Banach spaces) and a bit of harmonic analysis (integral operators, inequalities). The topics covered permeate all areas of mathematics (from number theory to applied mathematics) and are essential to all mathematicians.

<!---	<h3>
    Outline of class topics:
    </h3>
    (with the caveat that this outline is a mostly informal, very tentative list use mostly as reminders to myself)
    <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Week 1</strong>: Historical remarks and goals (problems coming from Fourier analysis and geometry). Review of R^n topology. Decomposition of open sets into cubes/rectangles (Q: does cube decomposition uniquely determine volume?!). The Cantor set (mention also the higher dimensional analogue). The notion of exterior measure, basic properties.  Measurable sets and their basic properties. Sigma-algebras (Borel and Lebesgue).
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Week 2</strong>: Ideas permeating "Littlewood's Three Principles": Measurable functions, basic properties including their approximation via simple/step functions. Egorov and Lusin's theorems.  Minkowski sum of sets and the Brunn-Minkowski inequality.
	<br>
	<br>
    <strong>Week 3</strong>: More on Brunn-Minkowski. The Lebesgue integral: simple functions, positive functions and measurable functions. Basics properties of the Lebesgue integral. The main limit theorems: monotone, bounded and dominated convergence; and Fatou's lemma. Riemann integrable functions are always Lebesgue integrable. Introduction of the L^p spaces. -->
