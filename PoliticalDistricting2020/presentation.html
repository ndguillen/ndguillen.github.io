Daryl DeFord is an associate professor of Mathematics at Washington State University. He previously worked in the Geometric Data Processing Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is affiliated with the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG), whose mission is to study applications of geometry and compu-
ting to U.S. redistricting, based on the belief that gerrymandering of all kinds is a fundamental threat to our democracy. Daryl's work with MGGG focuses on understanding mathematical representations of political geography and developing open-source software for analyzing districting plans. Additionally, he has studied the potential impacts of proposed language in citizen's initiatives and ballot measures on VRA compliance and partisan fairness. He has a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Dartmouth College with a thesis analyzing the dynamics of information flow in social and economic networks.

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<br>

The problem of constructing "fair" political districts and the related problem of detecting intentional gerrymandering has received
a significant amount of attention in recent years. Attempting to analyze these issues from a mathematical perspective leads to a wide variety of interesting problems in geometry, graph theory, and proba- bility. In this talk, I will discuss recent work centered around Markov chain sampling of districting plans that has motivated theoretical questions in these fields, including designing proposal distributions, evaluating the computational complexity of sampling, and measuring the geometric and partisan properties of districts.
Beyond mathematics, this work has also been appeared in court challenges, including an amicus brief to the Supreme Court last year, and helped inform legislative reform efforts. I will discuss what it is like to participate in these outreach efforts as a mathematician and some of the related data and computational challenges.
