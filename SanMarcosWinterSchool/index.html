<p>This is a minischool for undergraduate and graduate students interested in mathematics. It should be of interest specially but not exclusively to students interested in graduate school and/or a a career in industry involving applied mathematics. It will cover topics in analysis and scientific computing, assuming as only prerequisite a solid foundation in calculus and linear algebra. The three courses will broken in four lectures each covering all three days of the school. Lunch will be provided to students for each of the three days. Interested students must register via the link above -- and that is all that is needed to attend. This will be the first San Marcos Winter School, subsequent schools will be held at Texas State every January going forward. 	</p>
